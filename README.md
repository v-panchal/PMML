# PMML
Hello!

The R code and an example for Bayesian Logistic Regression Using Point-Mass Mixture Prior


1. PMMLogit.R contains the Gibbs sampler to compute the Gibbs chain using point-mass mixture prior.

2. Process_Gibbs.R contains the function to process the Gibbs chain produced by pmmlogit function.

3. Example.R includes a simulated example with 300 observations and 50 variables.
